    "- The Twitter handles are already masked as `@user due to privacy concerns. So, these Twitter handles are hardly giving any information about the nature of the tweet.\n",
    "- We can also think of getting rid of the punctuations, numbers and even special characters since they wouldn’t help in differentiating different kinds of tweets.\n",
    "- Most of the smaller words do not add much value. For example, ‘pdx’, ‘his’, ‘all’. So, we will try to remove them as well from our data.\n",
    "- Once we have executed the above three steps, we can split every tweet into individual words or tokens which is an essential step in any NLP task.\n",
    "- In the 4th tweet, there is a word ‘love’. We might also have terms like loves, loving, lovable, etc. in the rest of the data. These terms are often used in the same context. If we can reduce them to their root word, which is ‘love’, then we can reduce the total number of unique words in our data without losing a significant amount of information."
